# Sales-Forecasting
Demand forecasting is a key component to every growing retail business. Without proper demand forecasting processes in place, it can be nearly impossible to have the right amount of stock on hand at any given time.
Too much merchandise in the warehouse means more capital tied up in inventory, and not enough could lead to out-of-stocks — and push customers to seek solutions from your competitors.
So, what is demand forecasting? And how is demand forecasting done in retail? Below, we’ll explain demand forecasting and how you can use it to support your retail business’ sustainable growth.

To best explain demand forecasting, it’s helpful to look at the different methods. Some of the most common demand forecasting techniques include:
•	Qualitative forecasting
•	Time series analysis
•	Causal model

# Time series analysis
The time series analysis is a more quantitative approach to demand and forecasting. Rather than expert opinions and “soft” data inputs, a time series analysis uses exact numbers as the basis for forecasting demand. It’s a more mathematical approach to forecasting which uses numerical inputs and trends.
Other quantitative forecasting methods include:
•	The indicator approach
•	Econometric modeling
•	Trend analysis
•	Seasonal adjustment
•	Decomposition
•	Graphical methods
•	Life cycle modeling
